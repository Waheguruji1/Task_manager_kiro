## 🔄 **Data Flow & State Management**

### Task Management Flow
1. **Creation**: HomeScreen → AddTaskDialog → DatabaseService → UI Update
2. **Completion**: TaskItem → HomeScreen → DatabaseService → UI Refresh
3. **Editing**: TaskItem → AddTaskDialog → DatabaseService → UI Update
4. **Deletion**: TaskItem → Confirmation → DatabaseService → UI Refresh

### Daily Reset Flow
1. **App Launch**: HomeScreen initialization
2. **Date Check**: Compare current date with stored last reset date
3. **Reset Logic**: If new day detected, reset all routine tasks
4. **Persistence**: Update last reset date in preferences

### Navigation Flow
1. **App Start**: AppInitializer checks user state
2. **First Time**: Navigate to WelcomeScreen for name collection
3. **Returning User**: Navigate directly to HomeScreen
4. **Post-Welcome**: Navigate to HomeScreen after name submission

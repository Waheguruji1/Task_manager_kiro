# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Separate Tabs for Routine and Everyday Tasks
**Problem**: Routine tasks and everyday tasks were displayed in the same screen as compact widgets instead of separate tabs.

**Solution**: 
- Completely rewrote `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` to use proper `TabController` with `TabBar` and `TabBarView`
- Created separate tabs: "Everyday Tasks" and "Routine Tasks"
- Added proper tab styling with Material 3.0 design
- Each tab now shows its respective tasks in a clean list format

### 2. ✅ Material 3.0 Style Bottom Navigation with Shorter Height
**Problem**: Bottom navigation bar was too high and didn't follow Material 3.0 design principles.

**Solution**:
- Updated `lib/screens/main_navigation_screen.dart`
- Reduced bottom bar height from 60px to 50px
- Improved styling with better shadows and borders
- Reduced icon size from 24px to 22px
- Reduced font size from 12px to 11px
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with better color opacity

### 3. ✅ Fixed Task Completion UI Update Issue
**Problem**: When clicking to complete a task, it showed "task completed" dialog but didn't update the UI properly until restart or adding new task.

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote the `toggleTaskCompletion` method in `lib/providers/task_state_notifier.dart`
- Implemented **optimistic updates** - UI updates immediately before database operation
- Added proper error handling with rollback if database operation fails
- Tasks now update instantly when toggled, providing immediate visual feedback

### 4. ✅ Improved Task Text Positioning and Sizing
**Problem**: Task text position didn't feel right, wasn't centered properly, had short font size and small checkbox.

**Solution**:
- Redesigned task items in the home screen with better layout
- Increased checkbox size from 24x24 to 28x28 pixels
- Improved text sizing: title font size increased to 17px, description to 15px
- Better text alignment and spacing with proper padding
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with improved line heights (1.3 for titles, 1.4 for descriptions)
- Added proper text truncation with ellipsis for long content
